## Abstract
Blind and low vision (BLV) developers create websites to share knowledge and showcase their work. A well-designed website can engage the audience and deliver information effectively, yet it remains challenging for BLV developers to review their web designs. We conducted interviews with BLV developers (N=12) and analyzed 20 websites created by BLV developers. BLV developers created highly accessible websites but wanted to assess the usability of their website for sighted users and follow the design standards of other websites. They also encountered challenges using screen readers to identify illegible text, misaligned elements, and inharmonious colors. We present DesignChecker, a browser extension that helps BLV developers to improve their web design. With DesignChecker, users can assess their current design by comparing it to visual design guidelines, a reference website of their choice, or a trend of similar websites. DesignChecker also identifies the specific HTML elements that violate web design guidelines and suggests CSS changes for improvements. Our user study participants (N=8) all expressed enthusiasm about using DesignChecker in the future to improve their web design.
